 * correctly look broken.
 *
 * Now it groups by cause, using the same `diagnoseFill` the agent reads. Two
 * consequences worth stating: the causes cannot disagree with what the chat
 * says about the same fill, and a person can see the four reasons without
 * opening a conversation to be told them.
