 *
 * Recorded ONCE per task, guarded by a marker event rather than by trusting
 * the caller. An Action-Required fill leaves the task parked at fill-form, so
 * a second complete report (a double-clicked Done, a re-fill of the same page)
 * passes the state guard above and would silently inflate `seen_count` — the
 * recurrence number the whole learning decision reads. The gate lives here,
 * inside the tool, because callers cannot be trusted to submit exactly once.
 * Accepted trade-off: a re-fill that reaches NEW questions (a later wizard
 * page) is not re-recorded either; one undercounted page beats every
 * double-click permanently corrupting the denominator.
