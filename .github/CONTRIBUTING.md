# Contributing to OfferOS

## Prerequisites

- A recent Node LTS (the project currently develops against Node 24+; see
  `README.md`).
- `npm ci` to install dependencies exactly as locked.

```bash
npm ci
```

## Running it locally

```bash
npm run dev:web     # web app dev server → http://localhost:3000
npm run host:install # optional: one-click server start from the panel (native messaging host)
npm run dev         # extension dev build with HMR (separate browser)
```

For iterating against your own Chrome instead: `npm run build -w
@offeros/extension` stamps the unpacked output and a loaded unpacked extension
auto-reloads itself within ~2s of a rebuild (first load needs one manual
reload; open ATS tabs need a page refresh for new content-script code).

The web app is the product and owns your data; the extension is a thin
client that talks to it over `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Monorepo map

- `apps/web` — the product: the Next.js app that owns your data and runs the
  AI pipeline.
- `apps/extension` — the fill arm: a Chrome Side Panel that drives real ATS
  pages from the web app's data.
- `packages/*` — IO-free shared layers (`core` domain schemas, `llm` provider
  layer, `autofill` pure fill engine, `pdf` text extraction) imported by both
  apps.

## Gate suite

Before opening a PR, make sure all of these pass:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format:check
npm run typecheck
npx vitest run
npm run test:ext
npm run build -w @offeros/extension
cd apps/web && npm run build
```

A handful of tests are gated on a local Chromium install and are skipped
otherwise; run `npx playwright install chromium` once to unlock them.

If your change touches the extension's fill engine, content-script messaging,
or the side panel, also run the headed end-to-end harness once locally. Build
first — the harness loads the extension from
`apps/extension/.output/chrome-mv3`, so `npm run build -w @offeros/extension`
must run before `npm run e2e -w @offeros/extension`. It then drives the built
extension against a real Chromium instance over the actual `runtime.onMessage`
bus. It's a manual gate, not part of the automated CI suite above, for two
reasons: it needs a headed browser, and it currently has no built-in
pass/fail assertions — it prints one `E2E <check>: <value>` line per check
and always exits `0`, so a run only means something if a human reads the
output and confirms every line looks right before opening the PR. Adding real
assertions/exit codes is the prerequisite for ever wiring this into CI.

For a change that spans the web workspace and the extension, build both apps
and run the vertical-slice harness as well:

```bash
npm run build -w @offeros/extension
cd apps/web && npm run build && cd ../..
npm run e2e:vertical -w @offeros/extension
```

It starts the production web app on port 3000 with a temporary SQLite database,
loads the built extension in Chromium, and exercises Greenhouse and Lever
fixtures through profile lookup, JD capture, safe-field fill, fill reporting,
and application tracking. The run has assertions, exits non-zero on failure,
uses fake profile data, and verifies that the form was not submitted. Port 3000
must be free before it starts.

To check current public ATS markup without filling anything, pass one or more
application URLs to the read-only live probe:

```bash
npm run probe:ats-live -w @offeros/extension -- \
  https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/example/jobs/123 \
  https://jobs.lever.co/example/role-id/apply
```

The probe scans fields and captures the JD through the built extension, then
asserts that every form value is unchanged. It never sends a fill or submit
message. Because public postings disappear and their markup changes, this is a
manual compatibility check rather than a stable CI gate.

## Pull requests

- All gates above must be green.
- Behavior changes need accompanying tests — don't rely on manual testing
  alone.
- Follow the **web-first rule**: the web app (`apps/web`) owns the data and
  the AI; the extension owns the apply moment. The panel may _initiate_
  server-side work (instant fill, tailor, cover letter, fit) and complete an
  application, but it must not grow its own data store or make LLM calls of
  its own — everything routes through the web app's local API.
