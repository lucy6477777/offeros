/**
 * What became of one field.

 * `skipped` is the narrow one and the easy one to misuse: it means the engine
 * met a control, did not recognise it, and correctly did nothing to it. Every
 * consumer treats it as a non-event — it is not a problem in the diagnosis, it
 * is dropped from the required count, and the hand-back list only surfaces one
 * if it is required as well. So a field we HAD an answer for must never be
 * filed here; it is `filled`, an explicit `failed`, or `needs-user`. Four
 * fields once landed in `skipped` with their answers ready and went out of a
 * real application empty and unmentioned by everything downstream.
